# Project Overview
By working through the lessons in this course, you have learned the necessary skills and knowledge to develop a home page for a fictional client. 

Using your new knowledge of HTML and CSS you need to create a semantic structure with a header, main content and footer. Decide between a grid or flexbox for your layout. The client’s logo needs to be in the header and the main content needs to have a large promotional banner and three columns with text and images below it. The footer should have two columns. The first column must contain a smaller version of the logo and the second column should have copywriting information.

In terms of styling, you should use your creativity to create the appropriate look and feel to capture the attention of the client’s target audience. You should use your knowledge about CSS selectors and effects to create the appropriate intentional engagement that would serve your client best.

## Example Company

Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12–15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.

Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.

## Review Criteria

### Visual layout

When viewing the home page in the browser:
* Is it clear that this is a home page for one of the four fictional clients?
* Is the correct company logo at the top of the page?
* Is there a horizontal navigation menu with four links below the logo?
* Does one of the links in the navigation menu link to the home page itself?
* Does the main content contain a large promotional banner at the top and three columns below it, each containing an image and some text?
* Does the page have a footer that is split into two columns?
* Does the left column of the footer contain a small version of the client logo and the right column copyright text?

### Semantic structure

When opening the HTML file in VS Code, does it contain:

* A header element for the logo?
* A nav element for the navigation menu?
* A main element for the content?
* A footer element for the footer?
* Appropriate usage of other semantic tags such as article and section in the content of the main element?

  

### CSS layout, styling and effects

When viewing the home page in the browser:

* Is the use of CSS styling effective?
* Is CSS used to create appropriate interactivity?
* When opening the CSS file in VS code, ask yourself the following:
* Is it a grid or flexbox layout?
* Does it have the appropriate selectors to style elements?
* Does it specify any pseudo-classes to create interactivity on the home page?
* Are any animations or transition effects used? Do they improve the user experience or distract from it?

### Overall effect of the home page

* Does the home page create adequate interaction and a pleasing visual experience that is fitting for the client and its customers? 
* Are CSS styling and effects used effectively to create intentional engagement? 
* What works well? 
* What advice can you give to improve the user experience, layout and visuals of the home page?
